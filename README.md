# Ataxx Game

Ataxx is a two-person game played on a 7-by-7 board, with red and blue pieces. It offers an exciting strategy experience with a simple concept: players can either extend from a piece of their own color or jump to a distant square, replacing all opposing pieces next to the destination square.
